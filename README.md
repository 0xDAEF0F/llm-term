    export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/llm-term"
    ```

    - Windows:

    set PATH="%PATH%;C:\path\to\llm-term"
    ```

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using Cargo: `cargo build --release`
3. The executable will be available in the `target/release` directory

## Usage

1. Set your OpenAI API key:

   - MacOS/Linux:
     ```
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
     ```
   - Windows:
     ```
     set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
     ```

2. Run the application with a prompt:

   ./llm-term "your prompt here"
   ```

3. The app will generate a command based on your prompt and ask for confirmation before execution.

A `config.json` file will be created in the same directory as the binary on first run. You can modify this file to change the default model and token limit.

## Options

- `-c, --config <FILE>`: Specify a custom config file path
